# IMPROVEMENTS
This file will be a 'todo' list, I will check (`[x]`) each todo element (`[ ]`) when done with one.
What is the improvements? So far, people have been [`reaching out to me`](https://infosec.exchange/@loneicewolf/111993210560692974) and suggesting the following:

(Elements `!=` ordered)
- [ ] Persistence
- [ ] Exfiltration
- [ ] Process Utils
- [ ] Checks
- [ ] SelfKill
- [ ] Cryptography
- [ ] FUD
I will be writing a paper about this as well, it will also be a key concept in the [`zines`](https://github.com/loneicewolf/Zines) I will be making!
